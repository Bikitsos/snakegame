# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python.

## Description

In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat as much food as possible, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the screen border or with itself.

The score is displayed at the top left corner of the screen. A beep sound is played every time the snake eats food.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the game.
4. Run the game with the command `python main.py`.

Enjoy the game!
